What is the main action in the game
-----------------------------------
This game is a basic clone of the classic retro games Arkanoid and breakout.
The main action in this game is the paddle and ball interaction.
The player must position the paddle carefully and consider the bounce of the ball. 
The paddle movement was tweaked to feel "slippery" and bounces off the walls which 
adds to the challenge, you have to correct your movement and be careful to win!

What was the hardest part of the game to get working in Unreal
--------------------------------------------------------------
The hardest part was figuring out how to do the math for the angle and speed of the ball with blueprints and 
also laying the level out evenly and finding the right things to use was a lengthy process.

What is the most interesting part of the game
---------------------------------------------
The most interesting part for me is the mastering the paddle movement
and trying out the ball launch at different spots, doing both of these
made it possible to hit multiple bricks at once which was really interesting to see 
after play testing it.
