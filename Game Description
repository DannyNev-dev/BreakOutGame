What is the main action in the game
-----------------------------------
This game is a basic clone of the classic retro games Arkanoid and breakout.
The main action in this game is the paddle and ball interaction.
The player must position the paddle carefully and consider the bounce of the ball. 
The paddle movement was tweaked to feel "slippery" and bounces off the walls which 
add the the challenge, you have to correct your movement and be careful to win!

What was the hardest part of the game to get working in Unreal
--------------------------------------------------------------
The hardest part was figuring out how to do the math for the angle and speed of the ball with blueprints and 
also laying the level out evenly and finding the right things to use was a lengthy process.

What is the most interesting part of the game
---------------------------------------------
The most interesting part for me was creating my own physics material 
and using it in order to get the desired bounce,feel and look, it's hard to narrow
my choice down to one aspect as the project as a whole was really fun and interesting.
